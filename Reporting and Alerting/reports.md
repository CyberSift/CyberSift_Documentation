## Creating a Custom Report

Creating a custom report is easy in CyberSift. Before creating a report, plan what exactly you would like the report to show. CyberSift is based on kibana, which provides a very large number of graphs that can be utilised on any of the data you collect. 

1. If not already done, create vizualisations and create a dashboard with these visualizations. This dashboard will become your custom report.

2. When saving the dashboard created in step one, make sure to save the dashboard with a name that starts with "CS Report" as shown in the screenshot below:

![custom report name](https://github.com/CyberSift/CyberSift_Documentation/raw/master/Reporting%20and%20Alerting/static/img/cs_custom_report.png)

3. Open the CyberSift Dashboard, navigate to Configuration > Manage Reports, and **Add a new Report**. You will see the name of the dashboard you created in step 2 above listed as an option:

4. Specify an email recipient, and subsequently this recipient will recieve a daily email from your cybersift installation with a PDF attachment containing this custom report.
